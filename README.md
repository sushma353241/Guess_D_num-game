### **Guess the Number Game - README**  

#### **Overview**  
The **Guess the Number** game is a simple command-line-based project where a player tries to guess a randomly generated number. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is **too high** or **too low** until the correct number is found. It helps in understanding **conditional statements, loops, user input handling, and random number generation** in programming.  

#### **How It Works**  
1. The game generates a random number within a predefined range (e.g., 1-100).  
2. The player enters a guess.  
3. The game checks the guess and provides feedback:  
   - "Too High" if the guess is greater than the target number.  
   - "Too Low" if the guess is smaller than the target number.  
   - "Correct!" when the number is guessed.  
4. The game tracks the number of attempts.  
5. The player can restart or exit after guessing correctly.  

#### **Features**  
âœ… Random number generation  
âœ… User-friendly input handling  
âœ… Feedback on each guess  
âœ… Keeps track of attempts  
âœ… Can be modified with difficulty levels  

#### **Requirements**  
- Python 3.x  
- Random module (built-in)  

#### **How to Run the Game**  
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.  
3. Run the script using:  
   ```bash
   python guess_the_number.py
   ```  
4. Follow on-screen instructions to play.  

#### **Customization**  
- Modify the number range to increase difficulty.  
- Add a scoring system or difficulty levels.  
- Implement a GUI version using Tkinter or Pygame.
